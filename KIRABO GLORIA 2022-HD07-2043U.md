# What is NumPy, and what are some of its key features?
>NumPy stands for numeric python which is a python package for the computation 
and processing of the multidimensional and single dimensional array elements.
>Key features include; 
   1. Multidimensional arrays: NumPy provides a powerful ndarray object for representing
arrays of any number of dimensions. These arrays can be used to store and manipulate
large amounts of data efficiently.

   2. Fast element-wise operations: NumPy provides fast implementations of element-wise
operations such as addition, multiplication, and trigonometric functions. These operations
can be performed on entire arrays at once making them much faster than equivalent 

    3.Broadcasting: NumPy allows arrays with different shapes to be combined in element-wise operations.
     This is done through a process called broadcasting, which automatically aligns the shapes of the 
     arrays to perform the operation.

    4.Linear algebra: NumPy provides a wide variety of functions for performing linear algebra operations such as
   matrix multiplication, matrix inversion, and eigendecomposition.

    5.Fourier transforms: NumPy provides fast implementations of Fourier transforms, 
which are used in signal processing and many other applications.

    6.Integration with other libraries: NumPy is designed to work seamlessly with other 
Python libraries for scientific computing, such as SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

#How do you create a NumPy array using Python's built-in range() function?
import numpy as np

b= np.array(range(12))
print(b)
#also arange can be used
a = np.arange(12)
print(a)
#also range function can be used to generate a range of integers
c = np.array(range(2,12,2))
print(c)

#What is the difference between a scalar value and a vector in NumPy?
In NumPy, a scalar value is a single numerical value, such as an integer or a floating-point number,
that represents a magnitude but has no direction. A vector, on the other hand, is an array of numerical
values that represent both a magnitude and a direction. In other words, 
a vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction, while a scalar only has magnitude.

#Creating a scalar
import numpy as np
scalar = np.array(5)

#Creating a 1 dimension vector
vector = np.array(1,2,3)

```


```python
#How do you calculate the mean of a NumPy array using the mean() function?
import numpy as np

s = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

mean_value = np.mean(s)

print(mean_value)

#What is broadcasting in NumPy, and how can it be useful?
#Broadcasting in NumPy is a feature that allows for element-wise operations between arrays of 
#different shapes and sizes. It is a way to perform mathematical operations on arrays with
#different shapes and sizes without the need to create additional copies of data or resize 
#the arrays.
#Broadcasting can be useful because it allows for more concise and readable code, as well as 
#avoiding the need to create additional copies of data or resize arrays. It can also be used to perform operations 
#between arrays of different shapes and sizes, which can be especially useful in scientific computing and data analysis.

### Project: Array Statistics Calculator
**Description:**

In this project, you will create a program that allows a user to enter a list of numbers, and then calculates and displays various statistics about those numbers using NumPy.

**Requirements:**

- The program should prompt the user to enter a list of numbers separated by commas.
- The program should use NumPy to convert the input into a 1D NumPy array.
- The program should calculate and display the following statistics:
- The mean of the numbers
- The median of the numbers
- The standard deviation of the numbers
- The maximum and minimum values of the numbers
- The program should use appropriate NumPy functions to calculate the statistics.
- The program should display the statistics with appropriate labels.

### Sample Output
