This is how you should format the files in this folder.

1 - Make a copy of the original assignment file.

2 - Rename the file in this format: <assingment_name>: <student_name> : <reg_number>
    eg: Pandas Assignment_Atwine_Mugume_R003405234.ipyn

Note:
  - In order for the pull request to merge without conflicts, the original file needs to stay the same as my original file.

  - Your pull request should reference the assignemnt done: your commits also should reference the assignments done. (Please do not just name your commits randomly.)
