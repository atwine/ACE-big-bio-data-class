    "You must have a very good handle on how much data you have, both in terms of rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Data Integrity:` The first and foremost reason for checking the dimensions of data is to ensure that the data is complete and accurate. The shape of the data (number of rows and columns) can give an idea of how much data is available for analysis, and can help detect any inconsistencies or missing values in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Data Preprocessing:` The dimensions of data are important to determine the appropriate preprocessing steps to apply before building a machine learning model. For example, if there are too many missing values or too few data points, certain data cleaning or feature engineering techniques may need to be applied to prepare the data for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Model Training:` The dimensions of data also impact the training of machine learning models. Machine learning models require a certain amount of data to learn and generalize patterns in the data. If the dataset is too small, the model may not learn the underlying patterns in the data, and if the dataset is too large, it may lead to overfitting. Thus, understanding the dimensions of the data is crucial for selecting an appropriate model and tuning its hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Training time estimation:`  the dimensions of data can have a significant impact on the training times of machine learning models. In general, as the size of the dataset (i.e., number of rows and columns) increases, the training time of machine learning models also increases.\n",
    "This is because most machine learning algorithms require multiple passes over the data to learn the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. As the dataset size increases, the number of calculations required to process the data increases, which can result in longer training times."

    "- `Data consistency:` Checking the data types ensures that the data is consistent and in the correct format. Inconsistent data types can lead to errors or incorrect predictions during model training and testing. For example, when you keep the dates they should be in one format such as \"mm/dd/yyyy\" if they shift around you will have errors in analysis\n",

    "- `Memory optimization:` Checking data types can help optimize memory usage during preprocessing, especially when dealing with large datasets. Data types can be converted to lower memory-consuming types like integers or floats.\n",

    "- `Efficient data manipulation`: Different data types can require different manipulation techniques, and knowing the data types beforehand can save time and improve efficiency during data manipulation.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `Identifying missing or erroneous data:` Descriptive statistics can help you identify if any of your data is missing or if there are any errors in your dataset. For example, you may notice that certain features have a lower count of non-null values than others, which could indicate missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Understanding the distribution of your data:` Descriptive statistics can give you insights into the distribution of your data, such as the mean, median, and mode. This information can be useful for choosing the appropriate machine learning algorithms, as some algorithms work better with certain types of data distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Detecting outliers:` Descriptive statistics can also help you detect outliers, which are data points that fall outside the expected range of values. Outliers can have a significant impact on your machine learning model's performance, so it's important to identify and handle them appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Assessing the quality of your data:` By examining the descriptive statistics of your data, you can get a sense of the overall quality of your dataset. For example, if you notice that some features have a large range of values compared to others, this could indicate that the data is noisy or that some features may be more important than others.\n",

If the assumptions are not met, the results obtained from the model may not be reliable or valid. For example, if the assumption of linearity is not met, the results obtained from the model may not accurately reflect the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.\n",

The number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms are highly correlated, and including both features in the model can lead to overfitting. By identifying the correlation between these two features and removing one of them, we can reduce the complexity of the model.\n",

    "# Prepare Your Data For Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Many machine learning algorithms make assumptions about your data. It is often a very good\n",
    "idea to prepare your data in such way to best expose the structure of the problem to the machine\n",
    "learning algorithms that you intend to use. In this chapter you will discover how to prepare\n",
    "your data for machine learning in Python using scikit-learn. After completing this lesson you\n",
    "will know how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rescale data.\n",
    "2. Standardize data.\n",
    "3. Normalize data.\n",
    "4. Binarize data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Need For Data Pre-processing\n",
    "You almost always need to pre-process your data. It is a required step. A difficulty is that\n",
    "different algorithms make different assumptions about your data and may require different\n",
    "transforms. Further, when you follow all of the rules and prepare your data, sometimes algorithms\n",
    "can deliver better results without pre-processing.\n",
    "Generally, I would recommend creating many different views and transforms of your data,\n",
    "then exercise a handful of algorithms on each view of your dataset. This will help you to \n",
    "ush\n",
    "out which data transforms might be better at exposing the structure of your problem in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps involved are as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split the dataset into the input and output variables for machine learning.\n",
    "- Apply a pre-processing transform to the input variables.\n",
    "- Summarize the data to show the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scikit-learn library provides two standard idioms for transforming data. Each are useful\n",
    "in different circumstances. The transforms are calculated in such a way that they can be applied\n",
    "to your training data and any samples of data you may have in the future. The scikit-learn\n",
    "documentation has some information on how to use various different pre-processing methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fit and Multiple Transform method is the preferred approach. You call the fit()\n",
    "function to prepare the parameters of the transform once on your data. Then later you can use\n",
    "the transform() function on the same data to prepare it for modeling and again on the test or\n",
    "validation dataset or new data that you may see in the future. The Combined Fit-And-Transform\n",
    "is a convenience that you can use for one of the tasks. This might be useful if you are interested\n",
    "in plotting or summarizing the transformed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rescale Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, `rescaling refers to the process of transforming the values of a variable to a new scale`, typically to a specific range or distribution. Rescaling is often used as a data preprocessing step to prepare the data for use in a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rescaling can be achieved using various techniques, including normalization and standardization, as well as other methods such as `min-max scaling` and `log transformation`. The choice of rescaling technique depends on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rescaling is important in machine learning because it can help to improve the performance of the model by reducing the impact of features that have large values or different scales. Rescaling can also help to simplify the interpretation of the model by making the features more comparable and understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Avoiding numerical instability:` In some machine learning algorithms, such as gradient-based optimization algorithms, the scale of the input features can affect the convergence of the algorithm. Rescaling the data can help avoid numerical instability and improve the convergence of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Improving performance:` Rescaling the data can improve the performance of the model, especially when using distance-based algorithms or when the features have different scales. In distance-based algorithms, the distance between two data points is affected by the scale of the features, so rescaling the data can make the distance more meaningful. Similarly, when the features have different scales, rescaling can help give equal importance to all features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Reducing computational complexity:` Rescaling the data can reduce the computational complexity of some machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines. When the features have different scales, some algorithms may require more computation to converge, and rescaling can help reduce this complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Normalization:` As mentioned in the previous answer, rescaling can be used for normalization, which is a technique used to rescale data to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. Normalization can help in comparing variables that have different units or scales or when we want to give more importance to small values.\n"

    "Algorithm spot-checking is a process in machine learning where multiple algorithms are tested and compared on a specific dataset to identify the one that performs the best for a given task. It involves evaluating the performance of various algorithms using a set of standard evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score, among others. The goal of algorithm spot-checking is to find the best algorithm that can accurately model the underlying pattern in the data and generalize well to new, unseen data. By trying out multiple algorithms and comparing their performance, algorithm spot-checking helps data scientists and machine learning practitioners to identify the best algorithm for their specific task and improve the overall performance of their models.\n",

    "\n",
    "erent machine learning algorithms\n",
    "consistently. In this chapter you will discover how you can create a test harness to compare\n",
    "multiple different machine learning algorithms in Python with scikit-learn. You can use this\n",
    "test harness as a template on your own machine learning problems and add more and different\n",
    "algorithms to compare. After completing this lesson you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How to formulate an experiment to directly compare machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "2. A reusable template for evaluating the performance of multiple algorithms on one dataset.\n",
    "3. How to report and visualize the results when comparing algorithm performance.\n",

    "### Choose The Best Machine Learning Model\n",
    "When you work on a machine learning project, you often end up with multiple good models\n",
    "to choose from. Each model will have different performance characteristics. Using resampling\n",
    "methods like cross validation, you can get an estimate for how accurate each model may be on\n",

    "\n",
    "erent ways of looking at the estimated accuracy of your machine\n",
    "learning algorithms in order to choose the one or two algorithm to finalize. A way to do this is\n",
    "to use visualization methods to show the average accuracy, variance and other properties of the\n",
    "distribution of model accuracies. In the next section you will discover exactly how you can do\n",
    "that in Python with scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compare Machine Learning Algorithms Consistently\n",
    "The key to a fair comparison of machine learning algorithms is ensuring that each algorithm is\n",

    "# Chosen Model: Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Problem Representation:` Logistic regression is used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict one of two possible outcomes (e.g., spam or not spam, pass or fail). The output of logistic regression is a probability value between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Linear Function:` In logistic regression, we first create a linear function by multiplying input features (x) with their corresponding weights (w) and adding a bias term (b). This is similar to linear regression but with a key difference in the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Mathematically: z = w1 * x1 + w2 * x2 + ... + wn * xn + b\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Sigmoid Function:` The linear function's output (z) is passed through the sigmoid function (also called the logistic function) to convert it into a probability value between 0 and 1. The sigmoid function has an S-shaped curve, which maps any real-valued number to a value between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Sigmoid function: p = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Model Training:` To train the logistic regression model, we need to find the optimal weights (w) and bias (b) that minimize the error between predicted probabilities and the actual outcomes. This is done using a technique called gradient descent, which iteratively adjusts the weights and bias to minimize the cost function (e.g., cross-entropy loss).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Prediction and Decision Boundary:` Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the probability of a given input belonging to a particular class. A decision boundary is set (typically at 0.5), and if the probability is greater than this threshold, the input is classified as one class; otherwise, it is classified as the other class."

    "## Cross Validation (Model Evaluation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation is a widely used technique in machine learning to assess the performance of a model and its ability to generalize to unseen data. It is important because it helps to address the issue of `overfitting`, where a model learns the training data too well and performs `poorly on new, unseen data`. \n",
    "\n",
    ">> `Cross-validation provides a more accurate estimate of a model's performance on unseen data and reduces the risk of overfitting.`\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind cross-validation is to divide the dataset into multiple smaller subsets, called folds, and train and evaluate the model multiple times. Each time, the model is trained on a different combination of folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated until every fold has been used for testing exactly once. The performance of the model is then averaged across all iterations to provide a more reliable estimate of its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main reasons why cross-validation is important in machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "`More accurate performance estimation:` By evaluating the model on different subsets of data, cross-validation provides a better estimate of the model's performance on unseen data compared to a single train-test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Reducing overfitting:` Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including the noise, and fails to generalize to new data. Cross-validation can help detect overfitting by providing performance estimates on different data subsets, thus encouraging the selection of a model with better generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Model selection and hyperparameter tuning:` Cross-validation can be used to compare the performance of different models or to fine-tune the hyperparameters of a single model. By comparing cross-validation scores, you can select the model or hyperparameter configuration that performs best on average across different data subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Efficient use of data:` In situations where the available dataset is limited, cross-validation allows for more efficient use of the data by training and testing the model on different subsets, ensuring that the model's performance is assessed on the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "One popular form of cross-validation is `k-fold cross-validation`, where the dataset is divided into k equal-sized folds. The model is then trained and tested k times, each time using a different fold for testing and the remaining k-1 folds for training. Other variants of cross-validation include stratified k-fold, which preserves the class distribution in each fold, and leave-one-out cross-validation, where each sample is used as a test set exactly once."

    "## Model Evaluation (Cross Validation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating if a model is `overfitting` based on `cross-validation (CV)` scores and training scores involves comparing the model's performance on the training set and the cross-validation set. Here's a simple guideline to interpret these scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the training score is high and the CV score is also high, the model is likely performing well and generalizing effectively to unseen data. This indicates a good balance between bias and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the training score is high, but the CV score is significantly lower, the model is likely overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model captures the noise in the training data and is unable to generalize well to new, unseen data. In this case, you should consider simplifying the model (e.g., using regularization, reducing the number of features, or using a less complex model) or increasing the size of the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If both the training score and CV score are low, the model is likely underfitting. This occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. To address underfitting, you can try using a more complex model, adding more features, or fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "`It's important to note that comparing the absolute values of the scores may not always be informative.`\n",
    " Instead, look at the `relative difference between the training and CV scores to assess if the model is overfitting.` A large gap between the two scores is indicative of overfitting, while a smaller gap suggests a better balance between bias and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Keep in mind that cross-validation provides a more robust evaluation of model performance than a single train-test split.
